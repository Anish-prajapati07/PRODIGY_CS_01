# PRODIGY_CS_01
This is my first task of Prodigy summer internshhip.
Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
Steps:-

**Shift Value (Key)**:
 You choose a number, often referred to as the key or shift value. For example, a shift of 3 means that each letter in the plaintext is shifted 3 positions down the alphabet.

**Encryption**: To encrypt a message:
Take each letter in the plaintext and shift it forward in the alphabet by the chosen key.
Wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary(after 'Z', goes back to 'A').

**Decryption**: To decrypt a message encrypted with a Caesar cipher:
Apply the inverse of the shift used in encryption. For a shift of 3, decryption would involve shifting each letter 3 positions backward.
